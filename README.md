[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a3f84ab9-31a7-4234-af33-96b52e5c2d82/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/radreddit/deploys)

Note: React Router 4 isn't working with netlify out of the box. So browsing by entering URL isn't possible.
Looking to fix. I recommend cloning the project instead.


## Technologies/librares:
* Typescript/Javascript as web language
* ReactJs for view rendering
* ReduxJs for state management
* MostJs for modeling asynchronous calls as streams
